# Disnake Code Snippets

This extension introduces code-snippets for more efficient Discord bot development with [disnake][disnake]. This is inspired from what [wasi-master][vscode-dpy-snippets] has built, and includes snippets for disnake's implementation of slash commands, buttons and select menus.
